1820: Gears with digits in Difference Engine
	To give instructions, you change gears
	Invented by Charles Babbage

1945: Binary Code in electronic Computer
	Electronic Computer understands 0s and 1s
	Code with 0s and 1s

     		Eniac -- Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer
			Cons:
				Programming took about 2 weeks due to error checking of program
				Hard to find error

1949: Assembly Language
	To give instructions
		Use words (mnemonics) instead of 0 and 1
			Example instructions: inp, sta, add, out, etc...
		Assembler -> Converts from assembly to machine code

	Cons: Machine Dependent
		Different Computer Architecture <--> Different assembly language
	Need to understand Computer Architecture


1955: FLOW-MATIC
	Developed by Grace Hopper
	Business data processing language
	Uses english-like instructions

1957: Fortran
	Invented by John Backus at IBM
	First widespread compuled language
	Used basic data types Str, Int, Bool, double
	
1958: LISP
	Designed by John McCarthy at MID
	First 'Functional' paradigmed programming language
	If-else tree data, recursion
	Print loop (akin to python)

1958: Algol
	ALGOrithmic Language
	Structured Programming
	Code blocks with begin and end pair
	Influenced Pascal, C, C++

1959: COBOL
	Developed by a consortium of the US government and businesses
	Business-oriented computer language
	Based on FLOW-MATIC
	Stull used in 2023

1964: BASIC
	Beginners All Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code
	Developed by John G. Kemey and Thomas E. Kurtz at Dartmouth College
	Educational language for non-science students

1968: Pascal
	Developed by Niklaus Wirth
	Educational language to teach good programming practices
	Based on many other languages
	Replaced by C

1972: C
	Developed by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs
	Used to rewrite UNIX
	C Does not have automatic memory management (Garbage collector)
	No Error Correction
	Fast Performance
	Easy to program

1972: Smalltalk
1972: Prolog -- Logic
1973: ML -- Functional
1975: Scheme -- Functional

Enter: Object Oriented Programming
	Manage program in terms of object
	Break program into smaller pieces

1983: C++ (C With Classes)
	Developed by Bjarn Stroustrup
	Extended C with Opject Oriented Programming
	Still Very Widely Used

1991: Python
	Developed by Guido van Rossum
	Started implementation as a hobby during the Christmas week in 1989
	Simple, fast implementation speed
1994: Java
	Developed by James Gosling at SUN
	Intended to run on interactive TV
		Make programs fun on many machines
	After ITV failed java changed to web
	As web became popular, Java became popular
